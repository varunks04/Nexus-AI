## üöÄ **Complete Installation Guide**

### **What You Need Before Starting**
- **A Computer**: Windows, Mac, or Linux
- **Internet Connection**: For AI features and initial setup
- **Microphone**: Any microphone or headset for voice features
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

### **Step 1: Install Python**
Python is the programming language that runs JARVIS.

**Windows Users:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer and **CHECK "Add Python to PATH"**
4. Click "Install Now"

**Mac Users:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer

**Linux Users:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### **Step 2: Get the JARVIS Code**
1. Download the JARVIS AI Diary files to your computer
2. Extract them to a folder (like `Documents/jarvis-ai-diary`)
3. Remember where you put this folder!

### **Step 3: Get Your AI API Key**
JARVIS needs access to AI services to be intelligent. You'll need an OpenRouter API key:

1. **Visit [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)**
2. **Create a free account**
3. **Go to "Keys" section**
4. **Generate a new API key**
5. **Copy the key** (it looks like: `sk-or-v1-abc123...`)

**Cost**: OpenRouter offers free credits to start, then very low costs (usually under $1 for months of diary use)

### **Step 4: Install Required Programs**

**Open Command Prompt/Terminal:**
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, press Enter
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

**Navigate to your JARVIS folder:**
```bash
cd Documents/jarvis-ai-diary
# (replace with wherever you put the files)
```

**Install Python packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 5: Configure Your API Key**
1. **In your JARVIS folder, create a file called `.env`**
2. **Open it with Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)**
3. **Add these lines:**
```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-12345
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-api-key-here
```
4. **Replace `your-actual-api-key-here` with your real OpenRouter key**
5. **Save the file**

### **Step 6: Install FFmpeg (Recommended for Better Audio)**
FFmpeg helps with audio processing for better voice quality.

**Windows (Easy Method):**
```bash
winget install FFmpeg
```

**Windows (Manual Method):**
1. Go to [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Download FFmpeg for Windows
3. Extract to `C:\ffmpeg`
4. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your system PATH

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### **Step 7: Run JARVIS**
In your command prompt/terminal (still in the JARVIS folder):
```bash
python app.py
```

**You should see:**
```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
* Debug mode: off
```

### **Step 8: Open JARVIS**
1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to: `http://localhost:5000`**
3. **You should see the JARVIS interface!**

### **üéâ Success! JARVIS is Running**

## üîß **Required Environment Variables (.env file)**

Create a `.env` file in your JARVIS folder with these settings:

```env
# Required API Key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here

# Security Key (can be any random string)
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key-123

# Optional Settings
DEBUG=False
FLASK_ENV=production
```

**Where to get your API key:**
- **OpenRouter API**: [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) - Sign up, go to "Keys", create new key
- **Cost**: Free tier available, then pay-per-use (very affordable for personal diary use)

## üìã **What Gets Installed (Dependencies)**

When you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, these programs are installed:

### **Core Framework**
- `flask` - The web server that runs JARVIS
- `python-dotenv` - Reads your API key from the .env file
- `Werkzeug` - Helps Flask run smoothly
